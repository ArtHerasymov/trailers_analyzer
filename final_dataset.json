        "I am sorry for you... The technology of 3D movie was ill-conceived and movie directors had no idea how human stereoscopic vision works... To make things catastrophic, James Cameron created the worst 3D movie ever... Yes, the Avatar was totally stripped of billions of stereoscopic specular effects making all the scenes as if they ware colored paper textures...\n\nTo completely confuse viewers brain he made the actors and the scene grow or shrink during a single take and there is not a single scene in which actors would have their original size...\n\nSo, it is 2019 and not a single person in the World has seen real 3D movie!\n\nExcept for me :-)\n\nI will be making some serious money on Indiegogo selling 3D vision equipment and the first ever real 3D movie...\n\nSee you there and all the best in your life...\n\nMathew Orman",

        "Ahahahahahahahahahahaha!  You MUST be daft.  Titanic's \"story\" is so insipid that there aren't words to describe how painfully trite of a movie that was compared to Avatar.  And I, for one, consider it one of DiCaprio’s worst and most heavy handed performances… much due to the horrible lines he was given in that forgettable script.",
        "A box office success does not indicate quality of a film.  It indicates statistics like marketing, audience, time of release, and other factors.  Avatar was released just as Titanic was: In the winter, little competition, which led to repeat viewings.  Titanic, however, was far superior to Avatar.",

        "@Johnlindsey289 Avatar has nothing mature about it, Its an environmental film. Avatar is the highest grossing film, But highest rated? Not even close. in the list of highest rated sci fi films district 9 stands far above avatar. District 9 had a small budget, and made 100% use of it. District 9 has beteer pacing more original story and more interesting people. Also the message district 9 gives you is better then avatars. Aliens is better then avatar,",
        "@Johnlindsey289 Look, Avatar is overhyped/overrated. People were suckered into a film that had just a bunch of special effects innovation. But it had a mediocre/predictable story, sometimes the acting was bad too. The film also had bad pacing. And did not need to be 3 hours long. Even the dark knight was better then avatar. Dark knight had perfect pacing, a better story, and more interesting characters. That film made you go on the edge of you're seat eager to see what was gonna happen.",
        "Who the fuck cares if its a rip off of Pocahontas? or Ferngully, or Dances with Wolves, or the Last Samurai? And why wasn't it an issue until some guy on the internet mentioned it? A fucking 5 year old with down syndrome could've told you that months before the movie came out!",

And the icing of the cake being the regular sights of Gatling guns, dynamite, and small arms that had barely lived a month. And now Tonto and the Lone Ranger will join it all. ",

A truly masterpiece. It is impossible to make a movie 1:1 to the book. A movie is for entertainment, a book for meditation, because the process of absorbing information by reading is different to the process of viewing. So it was good that the movie was modified to the modern media, without twisting the whole storyline. Peter Jackson did a damn good job. Ian Mckellen brought the original book in the set. That's what I like. A director and the producers who are able to work with the actors and the crew as equal. A very efficiant and creative way to make it possible to bring a work on screen that seems too impossible to be shown in a medium like cinema.",

Like, sure, it has way over the top action for a medieval movie, couple of scenes with some sub-par acting and the story could always be better, but i genuinely had a good time watching this movie. I had zero expectations going in after reading critics, but decided to watch it anyways cause fuck critics. If you don't watch it looking for \"hidden antifa meaning\" and other bullshit which a lot of commenters here obviously do, and just take it for what it is, it's a pretty cool movie. I'm not an expert or anything, but I generally love a good fantasy movie, and that's what it is. It isn't prince of thieves, and it's definatly not trying to be. It isn't trying to revolutionize Robin Hood or anything, so stop taking so much fucking offense, lol. It's an action fantasy movie based on the story of Robin Hood, and a pretty cool one at that. It has all the things that makes a cool Robin Hood movie cool. Steal from the rich, give to the poor, nasty villain you hate the face of from first sight, cool medieval setting etc. The only thing i wished was better was the love interest, but to be fucking honest, i wish that about every Robin Hood movie and I like pretty much all of them (except the Russel Crowe one, damn that's boring, please don't be offended). Think maybe the cartoon has the best one.  My point is, don't go into to this movie expecting a historically accurate rendering of the old Robin Hood movies you know and love, cause then you're obviously gonna hate it, duh. But if you enjoy cool fantasy and are able to have an open mind about it, then it's 2 hours well wasted. Thanks if you bothered with reading!",

Without context the title of the movie can remind the average movie goer of another film by the name of Star Wars The Empire Strikes Back, or even Revenge of the Sith if you really want to go there. But honestly I think it’s trying to homage empire more given that this is the second film in the series.\n\nIt’s going for the same thing as empire, the big bad guy was defeated and the miguffin was destroyed, but that won’t stop the bad guys from wrecking shit up.",

It stuck with me through childhood, and not an ounce of sentimental value from Toy Story's story line and wonderful characters has left my mind since I've watched Toy Story 3.

Great action scenes & decent effects\nThe decade 2000-2009 had so many underrated SCI-FI films - this one, Supernova, Mission to Mars, The Cell, Ultraviolet, Equilibrium, Cube 2, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, Serenity, Signs, Hulk, Avatar (2004), Moon, Evolution, Pandorum, Push, A Sound of Thunder, Gamer, Resident Evil: Apocalypse, The 6th Day, The Box, The Fourth Kind, The Chronicles of Riddick etc",

        "tink 4 one fuckin second!you amature!",
        "@Enderwiggan1 You said it man. What really blew it for me was when in more than one instance, a Terminator grabbed someone and physically threw them. What a joke. In the first one you'd be dead if one got near you, let alone got its hands on you.",
        "John Brancato and Michael Ferris and the two most useless writers in the history of script writing, I'vre read shampoo bottles with better structure than their scripts. Like CATWOMAN? come on?? And then they went and made a mess of the Terminator Franchise. FUICK OFF JBMF",

        "EMP sheilding? i dunno about the new movies, but in the EU (expanded universe, comics, books, etc.) the places that got nuked were mostly russia and china, australia was actually completely left alone because they didn't have a standing military and skynet didn't see them as a threat.",
        "If that was taken a little further...nukes cause emps...right? if the whole planet was completely nuked wouldn't that wipe out all electronics? skynet in an electronic. wouldn't that kinda just end thhe whole story right there? idk just a tought.",
        "on the sys core remark I am guessing that you said that based upon the third film? From the looks of things T3 is being kind of \"forgotten\" and most of the new story lines comming out are being written as though some sort of \"alternate universe\" plan from that film is being used in the new storys. I could be wrong but that is what I am gathering.",

        "So they don't run on electrics? :)\nAnd why can't the faggot resistance make some more? Can't be that hard, how did we get them in the first place...\nAnd yea, I meant when people like John Connor and people were fighting them, just make EMP guns and shoot the terminators with them? Not before it all started...\nAnd why didn't the good termies in 1 and 2 or 3 actually, just kill the bloke that designed Skynet in the first place? Then none of it would have happened? :)\nAll excuses for films...",
        "excited about this movie. I have noticed since sarah connor chronicles alot of shit has been kinda filled in,ad libed and a lot of \"rules\" have kinda changed. Oh well I still must watch it all..gotta. This has become one of the greatest epic sagas of my life time as I am 26. I have been watching and reading all I can for 19 years now. Yea, I like Christian Bale and I am excited about this film. Hopefully it is not just a p.o.s. money grab exercise. Oh and they must have a cameron in it, please."
