        "I am sorry for you... The technology of 3D movie was ill-conceived and movie directors had no idea how human stereoscopic vision works... To make things catastrophic, James Cameron created the worst 3D movie ever... Yes, the Avatar was totally stripped of billions of stereoscopic specular effects making all the scenes as if they ware colored paper textures...\n\nTo completely confuse viewers brain he made the actors and the scene grow or shrink during a single take and there is not a single scene in which actors would have their original size...\n\nSo, it is 2019 and not a single person in the World has seen real 3D movie!\n\nExcept for me :-)\n\nI will be making some serious money on Indiegogo selling 3D vision equipment and the first ever real 3D movie...\n\nSee you there and all the best in your life...\n\nMathew Orman",

And I, for one, consider it one of DiCaprio‚Äôs worst and most heavy handed performances‚Ä¶ much due to the horrible lines he was given in that forgettable script.",
        "A box office success does not indicate quality of a film.  It indicates statistics like marketing, audience, time of release, and other factors.  Avatar was released just as Titanic was: In the winter, little competition, which led to repeat viewings.  Titanic, however, was far superior to Avatar.",
